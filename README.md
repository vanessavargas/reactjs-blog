# Blog Project

This is a project developed in ReactJS, based on the course "React: Developing with React Router in JavaScript" from Alura. Some customizations were made to the layout. Noteworthy differences from the course include creating the project using Vite and styling with the Sass preprocessor. Additionally, the Block Element Modifier (BEM) methodology was adopted to standardize class naming.
